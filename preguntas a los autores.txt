The ISIC-2017 dataset has 2000 images, but it also have and extra validation dataset (~150 images) and a test dataset (~600 images). Did you use those extra datasets for trainig or testing? Source:

Cross-validation:
Did you Stratified classes in cross-validation? Or even for a better comparison would you share your 10-CV split indexes/

The models AUC plot in the paper, are solving the binary melanoma prblem or the binary seborrheic problem?

Did you use the metadata (age and sex) for the ISIC-2017 dataset?

How did you deal with imbalance on the ISIC-2017 dataset? Weighted crossentropy? Oversample minority class images?

Parameters to train coding network: Max learning rate? Batch size?
